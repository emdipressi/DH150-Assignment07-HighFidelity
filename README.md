## About the Project 

### Summary 
My project focuses on weather.gov. This site has functions for basic weather searches for users current location or to more detailed information on weather safety features or phenomenal weather patterns. Upon first using this website, I was really frustrated with how inconsistent the different pages were from each other: different designs, text colors and sizes, and being taken to other webpages. Information that should have been presented in a clearer way was not and it made it hard to read and understand. My goal with weather.gov was to streamline the design and make the information presented easier to read and to fill in the missing gaps that were on the original website. I designed with a wide variety of users in mind: users with colorblindness, users that needed information fast and not presented in a complicated manner,  and users that are not a tech savvy as younger generations. 
 
### High-Fidelity
The high-fidelity prototype is the last step in this process of usability testing, user study, design, and low-fidelity prototyping. The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to test visually how the website will look and function. It can test the color, size, placement, and overall organization of the webpage before being programmed as a live site. My high fidelity prototype is for weather.gov. The tasks that are functional on this prototype are searching for the hourly weather for a specific location, checking the drought conditions for a current location, and searching for fire watch/warning information, and to navigate back to the homepage.

 
## Testing 

## Impression Test 

## Cognitive Walk Through 
> “I feel like the search bar could be bigger and more attention grabbing”

> “The menu has really good and relevant info!” 

> "The grey background might be kind of redundant. Keep it white or reduce the space."

From the cognitive walkthrough, I got feedback about making some elements of the webpage larger, such as the search location and some of the text on the pages. In order to make things more apparent I changed the color, such as the warning on the homepage from grey to red, and I moved the search function to be in a higher spot on the drought conditions page. I also got mixed feedback on knowing what was clickable and what wasn’t i.e. are underlined words clickable or not.
